## About me

I'm software architect heavily experienced on creating SaaS products and cloud solutions in different industries.

I have been in a direct management and architecture role for various years now and have a hands-on experience with a variety of industries, technologies and platforms including Linux and Microsoft stacks.

I have always delivered with focus on aligning IT strategy with company vision, employees and clients. In addition to my current experience, I have consistently driven teams to deliver a very high quality product within stringent time and budget constraints.

I can also master new technologies very quickly and love new challenges. I have an excellent success record on all projects I have worked on and have excellent recommendations from my past experiences in various companies.
